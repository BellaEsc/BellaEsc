## Welcome to my GitHub Page!
This is where I host projects I'm working on / have finished.

I'm a Statistics and Data Science student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I've been able to work on projects involving machine learning, time series, semantic similarity, and other data-oriented endeavors.
